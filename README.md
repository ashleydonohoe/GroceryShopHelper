# Grocery Shop Helper

Grocery Shop Helper is a web-enabled app that allows users to add items to their grocery list and get an up-to-date list of nearby grocery stores based on their location. This app is suitable for anybody who goes grocery shopping and wants an easy way to keep track of the items they need and find nearby stores no matter where they go.

## Using the Grocery List
The first tab of the application is a grocery list presented as a table with two segments: All Items and Favorite Items. Users can tap any existing item, which is stored in permanent storage, and see the item's information. When seeing the item's information, there's a star button the user can click to save or remove that grocery item to their favorites list. Favorite items have a red star filled in for easy identification on both the table and the item info page.

The user adds an item and its information by tapping a plus sign icon on the top right of the screen. The user is presented with fields to add an item name, category, quantity, price, and image. Adding an image is optional and not needed to save the item.
